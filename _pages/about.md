Hello!

I am Ruihao Li, a Computer Architecture PhD student at UT Austin, advised by Dr. Lizy K. John and Dr. Neeraja J. Yadwadkar. 
I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from the Shandong University. 
I primarily work on (a) architectural support for memory management and allocation; (b) workload characterization and performance evaluation; and (c) hardware accelerators for machine learning and other emerging application.
